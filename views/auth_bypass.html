<script src="/static/banusers.js"></script>

Authentication bypass can occur in any scenario on a website where content or API routes are not intended to be available to you.

For example, if you were an admin you would see a button below that allows you to ban any user! I have completely removed the button from this page, but did I forget to block the API endpoint from normal users?

Maybe I should check the network inspector...
